# AceyDueceyV1
A card game played against two computer opponents.
How to Play:
  1. Choose how much money each player starts with (10 is recommended)
  2. Your turn:
      - Two cards are flipped
      - If the first card is an ace, it's the lowest possible card
      - If the second card is an ace, it's the highest possible card
      - The hope is that that value of the next card flipped will be between the first two values
      - You choose how much to bet, you can select to do none to skip
